**Simple To-Do List Web Application**

Welcome to the Simple To-Do List Web Application project! This repository contains the source code and documentation for a basic to-do list application implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, and it utilizes local storage to persist task data.

## Features

- Add tasks to the to-do list.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Store tasks in local storage for persistence.


## Usage

1. **Add a Task:**
   Type a task in the input field and press the "Add" button. The task will be added to the list.

2. **Edit a Task:**
   Click on the task you want to edit. Update the text and press the "Save" button to save your changes.

3. **Delete a Task:**
   Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.

4. **Persistence:**
   The tasks are stored in local storage, so they will be retained even if you close and reopen the browser.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the to-do list application.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the application interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing event listeners and logic for task management and local storage.
